# Computational Reproducibility and the Methods Hub

Materials for the 2025 [ICWSM](https://www.icwsm.org/2025/index.html) workshop session on the use of [Jupyter4NFDI](http://nfdi-jupyter.de), [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) and the [Methods Hub](http://methodshub.gesis.org) by [Taimoor Khan](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/about-us/staff/person/Taimoor.Khan), [Lorraine Saju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorraine-saju-694630149/), and [Arnim Bleier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_fof5_EAAAAJ). The materials have been presented in the following workshops:
- Social Science Meets Web Data: Reproducible and Reusable Computational Approaches ([R2CASS](https://r2cass2025.wordpress.com))
- 1st Workshop on Validating Social Text-as-Data Methods ([VaLiSTAD](https://sites.google.com/view/valistad2025icwsm))

## Target Audience
This workshop is intended for participants in the social sciences who have at least some experience with Python or R and are interested in learning more about tools and workflows for making their research results reproducible.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the session, participants will:
- Understand the purpose and capabilities of the Methods Hub, and how to publish, discover, and execute tutorials and methods on the platform.
- Gain initial insights into key concepts and best practices in computationally reproducible research.
- Be able to use frameworks and tools such as Git, Python and R packages, and Binder to enhance reproducibility.
- Be equipped to publish reproducible computational analysis pipelines using Jupyter4NFDI and MyBinder in either Python or R.
